DESCRIPTION

The main aim of the project is to make a model that helps to predict toxic comment on the given dataset.


WORK DONE

Defining constants and cleaning of the comments.
Balacing the dataset and defining keras Model with GRU units. 
Then tokenizing the comments from train dataset and predicting acuracy score of comment id. 


LIBRARIES NEEDED

Numpy
Pandas
math
os
re
unidecode


ACCURACY SCORE

CONCLUSION

We created a model which predict the toxic comments. The model gives an accuracy score of the comments on the dataset.
